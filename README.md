# Content Script Cross-Domain XMLHttpRequest Example #

This is a chrome extension that puts Twitter trending topics at the top of Google News.

It's taken from Google chrome extension sample [Content Script Cross-Domain XMLHttpRequest Example](http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/samples.html#6871d09f4a96bf9d4b6cc724d00e909cee0f3902).

However, the Twitter trends API has changed. As a result, the original example no longer works.

I've fixed these problems.
